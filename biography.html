			<p>Jeremy Bradley Earl is a NY-based visual artist and musician in <br> the psychedelic folk rock band Woods. His drawings and collages <br>evoke shamanic illustrations for magical campfire folklore with an<br> easy, loose line work that endears and maintains an allure of mystery. <br>His work has been featured on countless album and tape covers <br> for his own record label, <a href="http://woodsist.com" target="_blank">Woodsist</a> / Fuck It Tapes, and is responsible <br>for creating an iconic aesthetic that is synonymous with the visual <br>language of contemporary homegrown / indie / folk / cassette culture.</p>
